## 6. Alice's Success Story

### 6.1 Current State (Before)
Alice is working on a database migration project. She opens Cursor and starts a conversation with Claude:

**Alice:** "Create a new SQL migration file for adding user preferences table"

**Claude:** "I'll create the migration file. What date should I use for the filename?"

**Alice:** *Interrupts flow, checks calendar* "Use 2025-08-22"

**Claude:** "Here's your migration file: `20250822_add_user_preferences.sql`"

**Alice:** *Notices incorrect format* "Actually, I need the format to be YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS"

**Claude:** "What time should I use?"

**Alice:** *Checks clock, calculates* "Use 143000 for 2:30 PM"

**Result:** 3 interruptions, 2 minutes lost, potential for errors

### 6.2 Future State (After)
Alice is working on a database migration project with @strix-ai/currentdt-mcp installed:

**Alice:** "Create a new SQL migration file for adding user preferences table"

**Claude:** *Automatically calls get_current_datetime tool* "Here's your migration file: `migration_2025-08-22T14-30-00_add_user_preferences.sql`"

**Alice:** "Perfect! Now add the CREATE TABLE statement with proper columns."

**Result:** Zero interruptions, seamless flow, accurate timestamp
