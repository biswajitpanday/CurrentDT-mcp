## Refactoring Opportunities (Future Improvements)

### Code Quality Enhancements
- [ ] **Extract Constants**: Move magic numbers and strings to dedicated constants file
- [ ] **Improve Error Messages**: More specific and actionable error descriptions
- [ ] **Add Input Validation Middleware**: Centralized request validation pipeline
- [ ] **Optimize Logger Performance**: Lazy initialization and async writing
- [ ] **Abstract Configuration Loading**: Pluggable configuration sources

### Architecture Improvements  
- [ ] **Provider Plugin System**: Dynamic provider loading from npm packages
- [ ] **Cache Layer**: Add caching for remote provider responses
- [ ] **Request Batching**: Support multiple datetime requests in single call
- [ ] **Health Check Endpoint**: Add server health monitoring endpoint
- [ ] **Graceful Shutdown**: Improve server stop process with cleanup

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Lazy Provider Initialization**: Only create providers when needed  
- [ ] **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections for remote providers
- [ ] **Memory Optimization**: Reduce object creation in hot paths
- [ ] **Response Compression**: Compress large JSON responses
- [ ] **Async Configuration Loading**: Non-blocking config file reading

### Testing Improvements
- [ ] **Mock Remote Providers**: Better test doubles for network calls
- [ ] **Property-Based Testing**: Generate test cases for format validation
- [ ] **Integration Test Automation**: Automated MCP client testing
- [ ] **Performance Benchmarks**: Automated performance regression testing
- [ ] **Error Scenario Coverage**: Test all error conditions systematically

### Developer Experience
- [ ] **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enable all strict TypeScript options
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Generate docs from code comments  
- [ ] **Development Hot Reload**: Faster development iteration
- [ ] **Debug Mode Enhancement**: Better debugging information
- [ ] **CLI Improvements**: More helpful command-line interface

### Security Hardening
- [ ] **Input Sanitization Audit**: Review all user input handling
- [ ] **Dependency Security Scan**: Regular security vulnerability checks
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of remote providers
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Track all tool invocations for security
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of API keys/credentials

## Notes
- Each phase should be completed before moving to the next
- Regular testing and validation throughout development
- Maintain clean, documented code following SOLID principles
- Focus on extensibility and maintainability
